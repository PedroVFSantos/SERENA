## Overview
SERENA is a comprehensive health monitoring application built with Flutter that tracks various vital signs including heart rate, stress levels, step count, and body temperature. The app features real-time monitoring, data visualization, and alert systems for critical health parameters.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.27.1
- JDK 17
- Android Studio / VS Code

## Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
  fl_chart: ^0.66.2
```

## Features

### Authentication System
- User registration and login functionality
- Secure data storage using SharedPreferences
- Email and password validation
- Persistent session management

### Home Dashboard
- Grid layout with four main monitoring categories
- Intuitive navigation with icon-based cards
